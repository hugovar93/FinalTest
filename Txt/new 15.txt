Case: 10142298 (https://firebase.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/5005Y00001vgEY3QAM/view)
Este es un Feature Request. 

Vi que habia varios FT relacionados a Lerna (no sabia qué es, asi que lo busque https://lerna.js.org/ por si tampoco lo conocen) pero ninguno relacionado, entonces creare el FR y al dev le responderé lo siguiente:
