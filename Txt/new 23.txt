Case: 10143312 (https://firebase.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/5005Y00001vgc3MQAQ/view)
Estaba checando este caso pero encontre que este dev habia creado unos dias antes sobre lo mismo y ya lo estan atendiendo 10143027 (https://firebase.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/5005Y00001vgVw3QAE/view)
Tengo entendido por lo que vi en chats anteriores que este se cerraria como duplicado?
