Case: 10141139 (https://firebase.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/5005Y00001vfsOgQAI/view)
Lo que el DEV manda es : I have an account that had been locked out for some time now and I need it to be recovered as someone had been using it and it's hacking into it my account scruzing@gmail.com and who ever is hacking into it I have the proof in pics which I attached
y puso como attachment una imagen donde pude obtener el nombre del proyecto porque no lo mando.

Ã‰l ya habia mandado un caso antes haciendo referencia a lo mismo (https://firebase.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/5005Y00001vfmetQAA/view)

Y pensaba mandarle algo asi tomando en cuenta lo que dice aqui go/fb-extra-support-playbook#hacked pero modificandolo un poco ya que si tiene un proyecto de Firebase pero sigue haciendo referencia a que necesita recuperar su cuenta: 


Hello Spencer, 

I hope you are doing great, thank you for reaching out to Firebase Support, this is Hugo and I will be happy to help you out with your issue. 

I understand that your account has been hacked, unfortunately account security is beyond our expertise however, I would love to provide further advice. 
If you have not done so, please consider the following: 

1. Recover your account by following the steps outlined here (https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6294825?hl=en&ref_topic=3382255&authuser=0).
2. Change your account's password (https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/41078?source=gsearch&hl=en) as soon as possible. This would prevent unauthorized users from having access to your account.
3. Read through Gmail security (https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7036019?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en) for a list of tips on how to secure your account.
4. Review your last account activities as discussed here (https://support.google.com/mail/answer/45938?hl=en&ref_topic=3394218).
