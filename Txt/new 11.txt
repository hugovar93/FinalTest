Hi, Stephen My name is Charle, thanks for reaching out!


I agree with you, it would be an excellent feature to have, Iâ€™ve filed a feature request on your behalf and this will be up for discussion. Please note that filing a feature request doesn't guarantee its approval. Something that can help us is a use case, defining specifications that are desired. For now, you can keep an eye out for updates on our official blog and release notes for newly added products, features, and SDKs.


If you have any questions or another feature request, please contact us through our support channel.

Regards,
Kary.*
